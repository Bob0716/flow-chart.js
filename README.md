#flow-chart.js
flow-chart.js is a tool in which users can learn to code through the creation and
interaction with flowcharts that can be executed similarly to real code.

The tool is built basically with JS and LESS, so it works (almost) 100% offline, allowing users to save their flowcharts
in JSON files or in the browser localStorage.

The project is derived from my final graduation work (wich can be found [here](https://github.com/BrunoRB/flow)).


## Supported browsers
Works perfectly in the latest versions of chrome and firefox. It should work on IE10+ but I haven't tested that yet.


## Online demo

## Building / running
Run "grunt" at the root folder to process the html template (for both dist/ and src/) and put the minified files in the
the dist/ folder.

You can open the production version (located inside the dist/ folder) by simply opening the dist/index.html file.

To open the dev version (located in the src/ folder) you'll need to open the src/index.html behind an http server like
apache or nginx. Opening the file directly will not work due the cross domain request generated by the less.js compiler.
