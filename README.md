#flow-chart.js
flow-chart.js is an attempt to provide a tool in which users can learn to code through the creation and
interaction with flowcharts that can be executed similarly to real code.

The tool works (almost) 100% offline, allowing users to save their flowcharts in JSON files or in
the browser localStorage.

The project is derived from my final graduation work (wich can be found [here](https://github.com/BrunoRB/flow)).

## Tests
This was a single man project (a very lazy man), so currently there are no tests (but I intend to change this soon).
